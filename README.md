# AWS-Landing-Zone
Deploy AWS Landing Zone using terraform.
In this project, we will use terraform to trigger the enterprise setup of multi account structure called AWS Landing zone. 
The deployment will be done via an automated pipeline which will include jenkins as the CI CD tool.
Jenkins will then provision infrastructure components on AWS account.
